# DiaBite : Mobile Development

## 📑 Description

This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on user input and provide personalized dietary recommendations. By combining the power of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) for accurate prediction and Machine Learning (ML) for clustering dietary data, we aim to create an interactive and informative health tool. The application will leverage Gemini to provide user assistance and answer inquiries.
